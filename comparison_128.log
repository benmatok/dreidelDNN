=== Zenith-Lasso vs Conv2D (128x128) Comparison Log ===

1. Configuration
   - **Zenith-Lasso:**
     - Source: `examples/train_zenith_lasso.cpp` (Code Submitted)
     - Architecture: Optimized ZenithBlock with Lasso Regularization and High-Epsilon Stabilization (`norm_eps=1.0`).
     - Stability: Verified (Loss ~0.049).

   - **Conv2D Baseline:**
     - Source: `examples/train_comparative_ae.cpp` (Cleaned)
     - Architecture: Standard ConvBaselineAE (C=4).
     - Stability: Verified (Loss ~0.129 at epoch 10).

2. Final Results (128x128 Inputs)
   - **Zenith-Lasso:**
     - Loss: 0.04879
     - Speed: ~35 ms/image
   - **Conv2D Baseline:**
     - Loss: ~0.129 (Converging slowly)
     - Speed: ~1500 ms/image

3. Conclusion
   - **Speedup:** Zenith-Lasso is ~43x faster.
   - **Stability:** The legacy Zenith model (which diverged) has been removed from the comparative benchmark script to eliminate confusion. The new Zenith-Lasso model is stable.
