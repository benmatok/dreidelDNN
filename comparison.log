=== Model Loss Comparison Log ===

1. Zenith-Lasso (Current)
   - Configuration: ZenithBlock (Lasso Regularization), GroupNorm(eps=1.0)
   - Input Size: 64x64
   - Final MSE Loss: 0.04879
   - Status: Stable Convergence (Predicted Mean/Zero)

2. Conv2D Autoencoder (Baseline)
   - Source: docs/COMPARATIVE_RECONSTRUCTION.md
   - Input Size: 32x32
   - Final MSE Loss: 0.02968
   - Status: Learned Reconstruction

3. Comparison
   - Delta (Zenith - Conv): +0.01911 (Worse)
   - Relative Performance: Zenith-Lasso loss is ~1.64x higher than Conv2D baseline.

4. Analysis
   - The Zenith-Lasso model with high-epsilon GroupNorm stabilization (eps=1.0) converges to the signal energy floor (outputting ~zeros), resulting in a loss of ~0.0488.
   - The Conv2D baseline (eps=1e-5) successfully learns features, achieving a lower loss of ~0.0297.
   - While Zenith-Lasso resolved the divergence issue (preventing loss > 1.0), it currently suffers from signal suppression due to the aggressive stabilization required for the sparse spectral architecture.
